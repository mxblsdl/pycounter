# Pycounter

## Purpose
A simple tool to count the lines of code for a project. While other tools exists for this purpose I wanted to build my own for a fun project. The intent is to create a CLI tool and to explore dev containers within VS Code to build this project.

### File types
While the tool will give a summary of the number and types of files in project, it will only give detailed stats:

- .py
- .md
